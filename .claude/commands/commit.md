* Look at everything in the diff from HEAD in order to understand what changes have been made.
* Consider how to break those change up into logical commits that are as granular as possible.
* Make commits one by one as me, refraining from mentioning claude in their body, ensuring that each one represents a valid state of the repository. Use hunk staging if necessary.
